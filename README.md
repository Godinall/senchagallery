Few days ago I was searching for a mobile image gallery and I found a great extension for jQuery Mobile at PhotoSwipe . It seems almost all the apps developed with jQuery Mobile and with an Image gallery are actually using this extension for the gallery.

However, while searched for the same with Sencha Touch, I hardly found something readily available. A number of  posts are there in the Sencha Touch forum asking for a ready-made component – but there isn’t available till now. So, here is one simple photo gallery with a tweak which I used lately for one of our products.
